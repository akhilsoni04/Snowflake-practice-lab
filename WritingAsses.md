# Request for Seating Arrangement with Regional Colleagues

Subject: Request for Seating Arrangement with Regional Colleagues

Dear HR Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to request a change in our current seating arrangement. Several team members have expressed interest in sitting alongside colleagues from their respective regions. This adjustment would help improve collaboration, ease communication, and foster a more comfortable working environment, especially for those who are new to the office setup.

We believe that aligning seating with regional familiarity can enhance productivity and team bonding. It would also support smoother coordination during group tasks and discussions. If possible, we kindly request you to consider this change and let us know the feasibility of implementing it.

We truly appreciate your support and understanding in creating a workspace that encourages teamwork and efficiency.

Warm regards,
